## Note
I didn't mention this in the video, but there are two setup test cases available. One with cars.mp4 and one with yes_car.mp4. When using yes_car.mp4, search for "user_car_images" in the code and add a 1 to the end because we are using different images to detect a different car. 

Also, for the UI, the user can press q to quit the application at any time. Then, it will process the frames it had created into a video. 

The IRL_follow.py doesn't work, because its mainly pseudocode. I don't have other connected cameras. I also have Google Maps on there because it woudl be more realistic. Anyways, right now use fake_follow.py which would be the UI of the whole application.
